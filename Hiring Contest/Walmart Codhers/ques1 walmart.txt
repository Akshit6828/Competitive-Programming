Tokyo finds that her boyfriend Rhio is cheating on him and she is in a fit of rage. She wants to destroy Rhio before exiting his life. Rhio has some crucial information stored with him in the form of strings. Tokyo knows that if Rhio loses the data, it would be a substantial loss for him so she decides to delete the data. 

Now, it takes m operations to delete an m digit number. She does not have this much of time so, she asks her guardian angel, the Professor to think of a way out. 

 He devises a method which says that she can delete parts of the number that have same digits consecutively i.e in one go. She could even concatenate the adjacent strings and delete them as a complete number if the above condition is satisfied. 

Now, she wants to know the minimum number of operations needed to delete all the data using the method. You need to help her to do so.

Given n positive integers, find the minimum number of operations required to delete all of them
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ n ≤ 30
1 ≤ Si < 1010
Input Format
First-line will input T, number of test cases.

The next pair of lines will input n and the respective numbers S1,S2…Sn in the next line.

Output Format
For every test case, output the required minimum number of operations to delete all of the numbers.
